# MiiGame #
## What Is MiiGame ##
**MiiGame** is a Wii games manager such as WBFS Manager. It supports ISO, RAR and ZIP(7z) formats for this project(currently only ISO file type). Please download the executable file or full source codes.

## Why This Project? ##
Because I have used many game managers, I feel some of them are very slow. I think that is because these projects are based on .Net framework. So, I decide to make a project with lite weight based on MFC by using Visual Studio 2008(Maybe someone thinks that is heavy, too :P ).

## About UI ##
There is no beautiful UI for MiiGame. It only shows the default UI from the MS Windows version. And this program is just started. There are many things to be done. Please feel free to tell me how to improve and what should I add into this program. I will do my best.

## About The Source Code ##
  * VC project named "libwbfsNETwrapper" is a copy from WBFS Manager 3.0. Please read the content from the site [WBFS Manager](http://wbfsmanager.codeplex.com/).
  * UNRAR is the source from the site [RARLAB](http://www.rarlab.com/).
  * libwbfs, I think this is released by hackers. If you know where is the package from, please email to me.
  * The others is from me. So, please use these codes if you really need them.
  * **Currently, it only supports 1 to 1 upload and download because of threading issue. Please notice this.**
## Download ##
  * Please download the essential part of this project. Of course, it includes Visual Studio 2008 Runtime and the executable programs. Currently, there is no executable part. The alpha version will be released soon.
